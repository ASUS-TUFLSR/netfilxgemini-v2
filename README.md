  - Frontend (React + Vite): Handles UI interactions.
  - Backend (server.js): Manages API calls, security, and interactions with external services (like Gemini API).
  - React cannot directly call Gemini API because it exposes your API key in the browser (security risk).
  - server.js allows us to keep the API key hidden and make API calls safely.
  - If you call Gemini API directly from React, Google blocks it due to CORS restrictions.
  - A backend (server.js) proxies the request, preventing CORS errors.
  - The backend lets us log errors properly and return meaningful messages.
  - If we need to add user authentication, databases, or other services, itâ€™s easier to expand in server.js.
  - Installed Concurrently to run both frontend & backend simultaneously
  - Used concept of memoization to avoid unnecessary API-Calls slowind down server
  - fetched the movies data from redux store which was initially null and used async-await inside useEffect(); for better api-calling
